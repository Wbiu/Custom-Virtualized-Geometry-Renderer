# Custom-Virtualized-Geometry-Renderer üíª
A custom Virtualized Geometry LOD Rendering Engine : cluster-based real-time mesh simplification and LOD streaming system inspired by UE5's Nanite. This engine dynamically switches between multiple Levels of Detail using a virtualized geometry hierarchy, supporting view-dependent streaming and cluster-based simplification.

## ‚ú® Features
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Dynamic LOD transitions** via a **graph** to reduce cluster overdraw  
- üß© **Cluster-based mesh partitioning** for efficient culling and updates  
- üöÄ **View-dependent streaming** with bounding volume‚Äìbased LOD switching  
- üç≠ **Debug views:** render **clusters** or **triangles (primitives)**
---
## üîß Technical Highlights
- üõ†Ô∏è Built from the ground up
- üì¶ Minimal external dependencies: [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Custom SIMD (SSE/AVX/FMA) math for vector ops
- üå≤ **BVH** (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) for cluster spatial organization
- ‚úÇÔ∏è **QEM** (Quadric Error Metrics) for geometry simplification
- üéØ Per-cluster frustum culling
- üì• View-frustum based streaming of cluster geometry
- üßµ **Multi-threaded** mesh processing; rendering on its own thread
- üåã **Vulkan RHI** backend
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Ready to support **ray tracing** via BVH

## üéÆ Ideal For
- Researchers exploring real-time mesh simplification  
- Engine developers experimenting with virtualized geometry  
- Anyone inspired by **Nanite** and interested in similar techniques (here using **Vulkan**)

## üé• Demo
A packaged demo app is available under **Releases**. Example meshes are included.  
**Note:** not every mesh will work‚Äîsee the project note below for details.
‚ùóÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏è On some system **Windows Defender**  will be alerted. So to run click on **More Info** -> **Run anyway**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏èüöß‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note to Project
This project was developed as part of my degree and is **not** intended to be a production-ready, bulletproof architecture.  
Turning it into one would require re-architecting core data structures (current ones use more memory than ideal) and improving robustness for a wider range of mesh topologies. Some meshes‚Äîespecially non-manifold or highly irregular ones‚Äîmay fail to process or render correctly.

## ‚úÖ Requirements
**OS**
- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit
 
**GPU & Drivers**
- A Vulkan-capable discrete or integrated GPU
- Vulkan **1.4** driver recommended (no SDK required to run)

**CPU**
- x86_64 CPU
- **AVX2 + FMA recommended** (this build uses SIMD paths for speed)
- SSE2-only CPUs may work with a non-SIMD build (slower). If you need that, build with SIMD disabled.
